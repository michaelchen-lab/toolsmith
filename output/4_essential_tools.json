This includes filtering cells based on mitochondrial content, ribosomal gene content, and number of unique genes (scRNA-seq) and identifying doublets.  The remaining cells are normalized and clustered to identify various cell populations. Pseudotime trajectory analysis is performed to assess changes in gene expression across a time course.  The goal is to identify potential non-transcriptional regulation."
